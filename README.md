# dataVisual
A data visualsation assignment made with the Proccessing framework for Object-Oriented Programming

My plan for the assignment is to visualise data of someone tracking their weight loss/personal fitness (i.e. no of kg person can lift during weight/resistance training.etc).
Just to give an example how the visualisation will work, I will load a data file with comma separated files (.csv). Each value in the file represents the total weight loss for that month.
I may add the option to click on the individual areas in the graph to jump into a particular month to see a breakdown of week by week later.

I intend to also allow the user to input values of the goal for that month and to input their the weight lost each week. These will be written to a file.

Also,I want to allow the user to input values of the goal for that month and to input their the weight lost each week. These will be written to a file to store these values. When done the total and average weight will be calculated, it will be displayed on simple graph. There will be a drop down menu or button to choose which data (Weight loss by week/.etc) to be displayed. 

Encapsulation and inheritence will be used, a separate class (Graph) will handle drawing the initial graph while the main class will handle reading in the initial set of values, the UI and the input from the user.
