My plan for the assignment is to visualise data of someone tracking their weight loss/personal fitness (i.e. no of kg person can lift during weight/resistance training.etc).
Just to give an example how the visualisation will work, I will load a data file with comma separated files (.csv). Each value in the file represents the total weight loss for that month.
I may add the option to click on the individual areas in the graph to jump into a particular month to see a breakdown of week by week later.

I intend to also allow the user to input values of the goal for that month and to input their the weight lost each week. These will be written to a file
